# winget notes and unofficial docs

winget is the software deployment solution that you want to use, but can't.
It *would* be ideal for installing, updating and removing (aka the whole lifecycle of) applications on both Windows clients and servers - if there weren't still so many unsolved problems.
I've involved myself in reporting or discussing these blockers because I'm passionate about systems administration, automation and I happen to be one of those weirdos who don't absolutely hate Windows.

That said, keeping track of wingets problems and their status, as well as just explainers for holes in the documentation or schemas has become overwhelming without a place to brain dump notes and reference. So this is it, eventually I want to publish this as a website (maybe using hugo again) but for now it's just a public notepad.
